🔧 How does TypeScript improve code quality and project maintainability?

TypeScript helps identify potential issues early during the development process, which reduces bugs and makes development more efficient.
It detects type-related errors before compilation, significantly lowering the chances of runtime errors.
Types are defined in such a way that even new developers can easily understand what type of input and output each function expects just by looking at the code. 


  🔧 What is Type Inference in TypeScript? Why is it Helpful?

Type inference in TypeScript means that the compiler can automatically guess the type of a variable even when you don’t explicitly specify it.

🔍 Example:

let message = "Hello, world!";

Here, TypeScript infers message to be of type string even though we didn't write : string.

✅ Why is it helpful?
Less code to write – You don’t need to manually specify types everywhere.

Improves readability – Code remains clean and easy to follow.

Prevents mistakes – If you later try to assign a number to message, TypeScript will show an error.

Boosts productivity – Faster development with fewer bugs.

Type inference makes TypeScript smart, efficient, and developer-friendly without sacrificing type safety. Want an example in Bangla as well?
